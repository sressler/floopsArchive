## Usage Tips
The original .wrl files are actually gzip files, so rename with .gz extension then gunzip them.
More astonishingly if you download and install Fraunhofer's Instant Reality (tested on a Mac) https://www.instantreality.org/downloads/ and then open up one of the wrl files, it actually plays! The sound even works however the interaction of clicks doesn't.
